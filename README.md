# arduino-led

This is a composition of several projects showcasing basic display-driving techniques using Arduino. 
It is intended as a learning experience, and a precursor for logic that will be used to drive an 
ArduNIX Nixie tube display shield.

There are examples of:
 1. [pwm-led] LED pulsing (fade up/down) using manual PWM
 2. [multiplex-led] Multiplexing
 3. [mux-pwm-led] Combination of PWM and multiplexing
 4. [serial-led] Serial control
